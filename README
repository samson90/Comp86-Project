Changes Made From Previous Assignment:
  - Animation added to player, monster, and switch class.
  - Sound effects added to the gun and monster class.
  - Gold scattered around rooms disappears as time winds down.
  - Added a difficulty setting to the control panel. Players can chooose
    between 'easy', 'medium', and 'hard'. Increasing the difficulty will both
    increase the speed of monsters and decrease the amount of time gold is
    left on the board.
  - Doors lock and unlock every few seconds to increase difficulty.
  - Added a game over and death screen to the game. Both screens show the net
    score as well as a gold and time bonus.
  - Player can move around the room as well as in between rooms.
  - Added a 'switch' object that the player has to pull to end the game.
